## Introduction

This repository serves as a centralized archive for ASIC firmware, preserving these essential software components to ensure they remain accessible over time. The goal is to support the cryptocurrency mining community by providing reliable access to firmware for a wide range of ASIC devices.

In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency mining, many boutique manufacturers have disappeared long before their mining equipment becomes obsolete. Others maintain poorly organized websites or rely on unreliable third-party file hosting services, making it challenging for users to find and download the firmware they need. This repository addresses these issues by offering a well-organized, permanent, and easily accessible resource for miners and enthusiasts alike.
